Booking ticket site

In the project used such technologies: Blaor WASM for client project, .Net Web API, CRUD operations UI with Blazor Server, SQL Server database with EnityFrameworkCore

This is the booking train tickets site where you can book either on high-speed train or on intercity train. All main functionalities work as expected such as search train,
booking moments and payment (there are 2 options: pay on the station or online by card). Authentification and authorization are present, therefore only admin can add new 
train routes in database, manager can only operate with bookings and client just to book tickets. Clients can also check their booking history when authorized.
